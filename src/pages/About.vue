                <p>In video games, a case (sometimes crate or loot box as well as other names) is a consumable virtual item which can be redeemed to receive a randomised selection of further virtual items, ranging from simple customization options for a player's avatar or character, to game-changing equipment such as weapons and armor. A loot box is typically a form of monetisation, with players either buying the boxes directly or receiving the boxes during play and later buying 'keys' with which to redeem them. These systems may also be known as gacha (based on gashapon - capsule toys and integrated into gacha games.

                Loot box concepts originated from loot systems in massively multiplayer online role-playing games, and from the monetization of free-to-play mobile gaming. They first appeared around 2007 to 200, but since then, appear in many free-to-play games and in some full-priced title.</p>
